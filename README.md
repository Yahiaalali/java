                        You do not need to worry about
how this function works yet - you
will learn about that over the
next few pages. For the moment,
it is just worth noting that inside
the curly braces of the function
are two statements. Before the closing </body>
tag, you can see the link to the
JavaScript file. The JavaScript
file starts with a variable used
to hold a new message, and is
followed by a function called
updateMessage().
